          <p>
            The explanations and information provided on this page are only
            general and high-level explanations and information on how to write
            your own document of a Privacy Policy. You should not rely on this
            article as legal advice or as recommendations regarding what you
            should actually do, because we cannot know in advance what are the
            specific privacy policies you wish to establish between your
            business and your customers and visitors. We recommend that you seek
            legal advice to help you understand and to assist you in the
            creation of your own Privacy Policy.

          <span>Privacy Policy - the basics</span>
          <p>
            Having said that, a privacy policy is a statement that discloses
            some or all of the ways a website collects, uses, discloses,
            processes, and manages the data of its visitors and customers. It
            usually also includes a statement regarding the website’s commitment
            to protecting its visitors’ or customers’ privacy, and an
            explanation about the different mechanisms the website is
            implementing in order to protect privacy. <br /><br />Different
            jurisdictions have different legal obligations of what must be
            included in a Privacy Policy. You are responsible to make sure you
            are following the relevant legislation to your activities and
            location.
          </p>

        <div>
          <span>What to include in the Privacy Policy</span>
          <p>
            Generally speaking, a Privacy Policy often addresses these types of
            issues: the types of information the website is collecting and the
            manner in which it collects the data; an explanation about why is
            the website collecting these types of information; what are the
            website’s practices on sharing the information with third parties;
            ways in which your visitors and customers can exercise their rights
            according to the relevant privacy legislation; the specific
            practices regarding minors’ data collection; and much, much more.
